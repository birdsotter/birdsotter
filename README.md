👋 Hi, I’m @birdsotter.

👀 I’m interested in data science and artificial intelligence for education. I am CEO of [LearnerShape](https://www.learnershape.com), where we are using AI to build the world's best open source learning infrastructure.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of code for LearnerShape's open source library, which is in the [`lsgraph`](https://github.com/LearnerShape/lsgraph) project.

📫 You can reach me at maury@learnershape.com.
